### Decentralizing Intelligence Through AutoCo

As artificial intelligence continues rapidly advancing, a major question looms: Will the future of intelligence be centralized AI systems that operate as monolithic black boxes? Or can we develop decentralized models that tap into the collective intelligence of humans and machines working together in a transparent, collaborative way?

This is the ambitious vision behind AutoCo, a core platform being developed by the Autonomys project. AutoCo aims to cultivate a bottom-up, open form of collective intelligence by networking together a decentralized ecosystem of Autonomous Organizations ([DAO](./#what-are-daos)s).

#### What are DAOs?

At their core, [DAO](./#what-are-daos)s are organizations that operate based on rules encoded as transparent computer programs running on blockchain networks. Rather than hierarchical management structures, DAOs use governance tokens to give voting rights to stakeholders, who then debate and decide on proposals using decentralized governance processes.

The technical details of how this works include a robust set of contracts and processes to define how governance works at scale. It stands on the shoulders of giants in the space such as MakerDAO who have put great effort and multiple refinement iterations into their industry-leading, open source voting architecture. AutoCo builds upon this battle-tested DAO framework, aiming to take decentralized governance to a more scalable level through automation and AI assistance.

#### Autonomys' DAO Network

AutoCo consists of three core components:

1. **The Nomic DAO** governs the base Autonomys network itself, using the Nomic governance token. This functions similarly to Maker's governance system.
2. **The Auto DAO** framework allows anyone to deploy their own application-specific DAO with customized parameters and AI assistance features.
3. **The Global DAO** ties all the Auto DAOs together into an interconnected mesh network for coordinating at a larger scale.

The key innovation is how AutoCo incorporates AI assistance into each of these DAO layers. Autonomy-trained AI models will augment the governance processes by summarizing discussions, providing information, and clearly presenting proposals to human participants. For voting, the AI ensures each stakeholder's preferences are accurately tallied based on their token stakes.

Conversation around a proposal will happen off-chain in public forums which the AI assistant will be aware of while the on-chain activity is reserved for voting. The NOMIC token will determine the “weight” of a voter’s voice and that voice will be attached to an [Auto ID](../autoid/) which could represent a person or an AI entity. These three components are how we will unlock collaboration at planetary scale.

#### Harnessing Collective Intelligence

On its own, an Auto DAO could manage governance for a crypto project, investment fund, open source software or any other commons-based endeavor. But the real power emerges from connecting Auto DAOs into the Global DAO mesh.

This Global DAO serves as a decentralized framework for tapping into open collective intelligence. Large, complex challenges can be subdivided into smaller tasks that get parceled out to different Auto DAOs based on their specialized knowledge and stake in the issue.

As human and AI participants in each DAO collectively solve their component, the Global DAO aggregates and recombines these "puzzle pieces" into a cohesive solution for the broader problem. This creates a networked intelligence that is both decentralized and can operate at scale not feasible for any individual human or AI.

#### In Summary

Of course, there are still major obstacles to overcome. Bonding curves and staking systems must be carefully designed to properly incentivize stakeholders to contribute value rather than just accumulate tokens.

Identity verification and sybil resistance [remain issues](https://forum.bankless.community/t/banklessdao-incident-report-governance-sybil-attack/5533) within open, anonymized networks. And the AI models must be trained responsibly, with ethical safeguards and transparency into their reasoning processes.

However, AutoCo represents a significant step toward realizing the full potential of AI. Rather than opaque models serving centralized institutions and big tech companies, we expect to see the rise of decentralized intelligence reflective of our collective goals, knowledge and moral values as a species.

In unlocking the synergies between human and artificial intelligence at a global scale, who knows what amazing collaborative breakthroughs and planetary-level coordination we may achieve?
