# What is a DAO?

**What is a DAO?**

A DAO, or Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is an organization that is governed by rules encoded as computer programs called smart contracts on a blockchain network. Here's how a DAO typically works:

1. Smart Contract Rules: The core of a DAO is its smart contract, which defines the organizational rules, decision-making processes, and how the DAO's funds can be spent. These rules are immutable and transparent on the blockchain.
2. Token-based Voting: DAOs often have a native cryptocurrency token that represents governance rights. Token holders can vote on proposals or decisions put forth by the DAO, with voting power proportional to the number of tokens held.
3. Proposal Submission: Anyone can typically submit proposals for the DAO to consider, such as changes to the DAO's code, funding requests, or other governance decisions.
4. Voting Period: Once a proposal is submitted, there is a predetermined voting period during which token holders can cast their votes.
5. Execution of Approved Proposals: If a proposal passes the voting threshold (e.g., a majority or supermajority of votes), the DAO's smart contract automatically executes the approved action or change.
6. Funding and Treasuries: DAOs can have a shared treasury funded by token sales, fees, or other revenue sources. Approved proposals can request funds from this treasury for projects, hiring, or other expenses.
7. Transparency and Immutability: All DAO activities, including proposals, votes, and financial transactions, are recorded on the blockchain, providing transparency and an immutable ledger.

The key principles of a DAO are decentralized governance, autonomous execution of rules through smart contracts, and transparency of operations on the blockchain. This allows for collective decision-making and management without a centralized authority, enabling new forms of decentralized organizations and collaboration.

**Voting: Majority vs Supermajority**

The difference between a majority and a supermajority lies in the proportion of votes required for a decision to be approved:

Majority:

* A majority means more than half of the total votes.
* For example, if there are 100 total votes, a majority would be 51 or more votes in favor.
* A simple majority is the minimum threshold for approval in many decision-making processes.

Supermajority:

* A supermajority refers to a predetermined portion greater than a simple majority, such as two-thirds or three-quarters of the total votes.
* For example, with 100 total votes, a two-thirds supermajority would require at least 67 votes in favor for approval.
* Supermajority requirements are often used for decisions that are considered more significant or consequential, as they require a higher level of consensus.

The main difference is that a supermajority has a higher threshold for approval compared to a simple majority. This makes it more difficult for a decision to be approved, as it requires a greater proportion of voters to be in agreement.

Supermajority rules are commonly used in contexts where protecting the interests of a minority is important, or for decisions that could have a major impact on an organization or community. The higher threshold aims to build broader consensus and prevent a slim majority from pushing through controversial changes.
