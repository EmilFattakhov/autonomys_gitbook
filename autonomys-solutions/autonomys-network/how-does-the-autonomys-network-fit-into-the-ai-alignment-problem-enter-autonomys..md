# Autonomys Network is the first network designed for humans and AI

The role of the Subspace Network within the AI alignment dilemma demands attention. With its unique consensus algorithm and blockchain architecture, Subspace Network constitutes a technology. As a technology, the emphasis shifts towards the impact and solutions it offers rather than the technology itself.

A significant transformation awaits, with the Subspace Network evolving beyond its current identity. The Autonomys Network positions the technology as the foundation of a network that embraces both human and AI interaction. This change heralds the inception of the first blockchain network catering to both humans and AI â€“ an unprecedented move crucial for the future.

Autonomys stands out as the first identity and financial network accommodating both humans and AI. It offers unique opportunities for shared identities and financial transactions across both humans and AI, paving the way for an alternate future of autonomy. This vision for an autonomous economy and the age of autonomy presents a fresh perspective on the agentic AI-driven future, highlighting the transformative power of this network.

The Autonomys Network, powered by Subspace hosts a number of the foundational tools required for our agentic future.
