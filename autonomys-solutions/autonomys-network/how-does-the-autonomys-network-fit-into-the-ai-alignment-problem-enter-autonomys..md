# How does the Autonomys Network fit into the AI alignment problem? Enter Autonomys.

The role of the Subspace Network within the AI alignment dilemma demands attention. With its unique consensus algorithm and blockchain architecture, Subspace Network constitutes a technology. As a technology, the emphasis shifts towards the impact and solutions it offers rather than the technology itself.

The objective involves transcending the confines of abstract laboratory experiments to address real-world problems, creating value and enabling significant changes for humanity.

As discussions around AI and blockchain focus on potential solutions for the alignment problem on a global scale, Subspace Network emerges as a pivotal player. This transition towards a tangible impact on the everyday lives of people signifies a movement towards a brighter, safer, and more meaningful future.

A significant transformation awaits, with the Subspace Network evolving beyond its current identity. The rebranding to Autonomys marks a new chapter, positioning the technology as the foundation of a network that embraces both human and AI interaction. This change heralds the inception of the first blockchain network catering to both humans and AI â€“ an unprecedented move crucial for the future.

Autonomys stands out as the first identity and financial network accommodating both humans and AI. It offers unique opportunities for shared identities and financial transactions across both humans and AI, paving the way for an alternate future of autonomy. This vision for an autonomous economy and the age of autonomy presents a fresh perspective on the agentic AI-driven future, highlighting the transformative power of this network.
