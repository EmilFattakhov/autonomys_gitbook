# Competing Visions for Our AI Future

## Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

As we stand on the cusp of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), a future filled with both promise and uncertainty beckons. AGI's imminent arrival, capable of performing any task a human can, poses profound questions about society's readiness for such transformative power. Drawing on insights from key researchers and the pivotal work ["Superintelligence" by Nick Bostrom](https://dorshon.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/superintelligence-paths-dangers-strategies-by-nick-bostrom.pdf), the need for proactive, robust preparation is clear.&#x20;

The ethical quandaries of AGI development, from determining moral agency to the autonomy of AI entities, challenge us to rethink our values in this new context. Central to this ethical debate is the autonomy of both humans and AI, urging a future where AI enhances human freedom and aligns with our deepest values.

### **Shaping the Future with AI**

The advent of AI heralds a seismic shift towards a society where abundance will redefine our economic models, suggesting a future beyond scarcity. Yet, this optimistic view requires a balanced, ethical approach to AI development, emphasizing autonomy and human values. The potential of AI to reshape our world is undeniable, but navigating this future demands a commitment to ethical integrity and a reevaluation of our societal values.

The alignment problem underscores the urgency of ensuring AGI's goals harmonize with human ethics and interests. As AGI threatens to eclipse human roles, we're compelled to redefine human value and purpose in a world enriched by AI. Addressing these challenges necessitates a blend of technical ingenuity, ethical insight, and societal dialogue, setting the stage for a harmonious AI-human future.

Envisioning a new era of autonomy, we see an opportunity to reconstruct societal norms and our interaction with technology. This future prioritizes the autonomy of both humans and AI, supported by an infrastructure that promotes decentralized governance and equitable technology access, with blockchain and web3 technologies serving as the bedrock for this new society.\
