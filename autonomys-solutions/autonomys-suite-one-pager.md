# Autonomy's Suite one-pager

Auto ID emerges as a pivotal concept within the network, symbolizing autonomous digital identity applicable to both humans and artificial intelligence. Currently, assigning a verifiable identity to AI challenges existing frameworks, a gap Autonomys network aims to bridge, offering a unified solution for identity verification for both humans and AI.

A blockchain network, to attract widespread adoption, must facilitate payments efficiently and on a large scale. Stability in the network's currency proves essential for user confidence and practical utility. Hence, Auto Cash serves as the stablecoin foundation for the Autonomys Economy.

Transitioning from Subspace Credits, the network introduces Auto Coin as its native token. This change, purely in nomenclature, reflects the broader rebranding effort, maintaining the functional attributes of its predecessor.

Developers will find the Auto Kit or Auto SDK instrumental in leveraging the network's capabilities. This toolkit diverges from traditional approaches like smart contract creation or Dapp development. Instead, it simplifies interactions with the blockchain through straightforward APIs. These interfaces facilitate a range of actions from identity creation, registration, revocation, renewal, to payment transactions, catering specifically to AI and web developers, moving beyond the conventional web3 developer audience.
