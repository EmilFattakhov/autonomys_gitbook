# Autonomy's Suite one-pager

The vision of Autonomys is to safely accelerate the worldâ€™s transition to the autonomous economy, a decentralized economy where all autonomous entities, be they natural humans or artificially intelligent systems, may trust, transact, and collaborate with one another. This vision stands in stark contrast to Worldcoin, which instead seeks to accelerate the obsolescence of human beings and formalize their dependence on centralized companies like Open AI through a system of universal basic slavery.

Autonomys brings a set of solution to the table, that will be discussed in greater details in the upcoming sections.

\
**Autonomys Network**

The Autonomys Network is an instance of the Subspace protocol which has a number of custom domains that deliver products such as Auto ID and AutoCo among others.

**AutoID**

Auto ID is a new form of digital identity, rooted in public key cryptography, that may be issued to both humans and AI.

**AutoKit**

Auto Kit is a Software Development Kit (SDK) that allows AI and Web developers to easily interact with the Autonomys Network through familiar programming languages like Python and Javascript, without needing to understand how blockchains or smart contracts work.

**AutoCo**

AutoCo is the native governance protocol, a framework for deploying unique instances of an Auto Collective for application specific or private use-cases that employ AI facilitated governance, and an open network of Auto DAOs that supports humaic consensus and Open Collective Intelligence (OCI) at global scale, providing a decentralized, bottom-up alternative to centralized, monolithic AGI and ASI.

**AutoFi**

AutoFi presents an ecosystem of inherent smart contract arenas, developed atop the Autonomy network, catering to a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities [pertinent to Auto Cash and Auto Coin.](https://www.notion.so/An-Introduction-to-Auto-Coin-and-Auto-Cash-a547f64e157f43a6a4410bd9b6c0c97c?pvs=21)

**AutoPeer**

Auto Peer is a cross-platform desktop application that allows anyone to easily share free storage in order to earn Auto Coin and help secure the Autonomys Network.

**AutoPKI**

A decentralized form of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that anyone or anything may use to register and verify online identity.
