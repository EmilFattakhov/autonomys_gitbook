# How Can Someone Create and Register an Auto ID

#### How Can Someone Create and Register an Auto ID?

**Auto App:** Anyone can easily create an Auto ID using the cross-platform Auto mobile app. This app simplifies and automates the process of creating your Auto ID and managing your keys, while making it easy to link your Auto ID to existing accounts and services. The Auto app is fully open-source and does not rely on any backend servers or platforms to store your personal information or secret credentials. Everything runs locally on your device, allowing you to maintain full control over your digital identity.

**Auto Registry:** While entities are not required to register their Auto ID, registration does afford several benefits, including public verifiability, the ability to revoke delegate Auto IDs, and the ability to recover lost or stolen Auto IDs more easily. A valid Auto ID may be registered in any compatible public database. The default global auto registry is powered by the Subspace Network, an energy-efficient, massively-scalable, permissionless public blockchain. Anyone who can demonstrate a valid proof-of-personhood (an Auto ID with a high human score) may upload their Auto ID to the registry for free. This can be done through the public [LetsID.ai](http://letsid.ai) portal, provided by the non-profit Autonomys Association.
