# AutoFi

AutoFi presents an ecosystem of inherent smart contract arenas, developed atop the Autonomys network, catering to a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities [pertinent to Auto Cash and Auto Coin.](an-introduction-to-autocoin-and-autocash.md)

This framework utilizes Auto ID as the cornerstone for conducting financial transactions and offerings.

**How?**

The process starts with **AutoBridge**, a protocol facilitating asset transfer across blockchain networks (e.g., moving AutoCoin from Autonomy's Consensus Chain to Ethereum).

Subsequent to asset transfer, **Auto Swap** facilitates the conversion of Auto Coin into a stablecoin, a digital currency designed to maintain a stable value by anchoring its worth to stable assets (such as the [USDT stablecoin](https://tether.to/en/), tied to the US dollar's value).

For the purpose of converting Auto Coin to USDT, **Auto Swap** incorporates an Auto Coin <> USDT liquidity pool. These pools are critical for enabling trade by supplying liquidity via token pools managed by smart contracts (more about liquidity pools [here](../../additional-learning/technology-basics/introduction-to-defi.md)).

However, not every financial transaction within AutoFi requires bridging. Auto Coin tokens, acquired by farmers who pledge their unused disk space through the[ Auto Peer app](../autopeer/), can be staked as well.

**Staking Auto Coins?**

Operators must lock-up (stake) a certain minimum quantity of Auto Coins to gain the right to conduct transactions within the execution environments of Autonomys Network (called [domains](https://subnomicon.subspace.network/docs/category/domains)).

Therefore, to execute and process blocks, these operators must garner sufficient support and endorsement (nomination) from Auto Coin holders and farmers.

Once operators pool and lock-up the necessary amount of Auto Coins from their nominators, they start executing transactions and producing blocks. For their work, operators are compensated with a nomination tax, a commission collected from the Auto Coin fees generated by executing and validating transactions, prior to their distribution among the nominators who supported their staked pool.

**Why would operators and nominators be motivated to deposit and stake more Auto Coins than the minimum required?**

The generation of a new block and the accumulation of Auto Coins depend on the operatorâ€™s selection as "slot leaders," a process directly influenced by the volume of Auto Coins staked by the operators and their nominators. This mechanism motivates farmers to increase their stakes, thereby enhancing their operators' chances of being elected as slot leaders and earning Auto Coin. Similarly, operators are motivated to attract as many nominators as possible (up to a maximum of 256) to amplify their stake.
