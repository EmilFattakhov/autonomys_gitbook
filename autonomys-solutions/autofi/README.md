# AutoFi

AutoFi presents an ecosystem of inherent smart contract arenas, developed atop the Autonomys network, catering to a variety of decentralized finance (DeFi) functionalities [pertinent to Auto Cash and Auto Coin.](an-introduction-to-autocoin-and-autocash.md) This framework utilizes Auto ID as the cornerstone for conducting financial transactions and offerings.

**How?**

The process starts with **AutoBridge**, a protocol facilitating asset transfer across blockchain networks (e.g., moving AutoCoin from Autonomy's Consensus Chain to Ethereum).

Subsequent to asset transfer, **Auto Swap** facilitates the conversion of Auto Coin into a stablecoin, a digital currency designed to maintain a stable value by anchoring its worth to stable assets (such as the [USDT stablecoin](https://tether.to/en/), tied to the US dollar's value). For the purpose of converting Auto Coin to USDT, **Auto Swap** incorporates an Auto Coin <> USDT liquidity pool. These pools are critical for enabling trade by supplying liquidity via token pools managed by smart contracts (more about liquidity pools [here](../../additional-learning/technology-basics/introduction-to-defi.md)).

However, not every financial transaction within AutoFi requires bridging. Auto Coin tokens, acquired by farmers who pledge their unused disk space through the[ Auto Peer app](../autopeer/), can be staked as well.

**Staking Auto Coins?**

Operators must lock up (stake) a certain minimum quantity of Auto Coins to gain the right to conduct transactions within the execution environments of Autonomys Network (called [domains](https://subnomicon.subspace.network/docs/category/domains)). To increase the chance of executing and processing blocks, Auto Coin holders can nominate operators. The larger the pool, the higher the probability of producing a bundle and getting a reward for it. Operators are motivated to attract as many nominators as possible (up to a maximum of 256) to increase theor staking pool.

Operators are compensated for producing bundles with a nomination tax, a commission collected from the Auto Coin fees generated by executing and validating transactions. A portion of the commission is distributed among the nominators who supported operators by adding Auto Coins to their staked pool.
