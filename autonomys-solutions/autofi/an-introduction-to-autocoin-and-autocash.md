# An Introduction to AutoCoin and AutoCash

Our belief holds that AI can lead to increased decentralization and autonomy, given the right framework for success. The emphasis on autonomy includes both humans and AI as independent entities that, when collaborating, can achieve more than the sum of the parts through collective autonomy.

To join this new world, anyone with a consumer-level computer can download the Auto Peer app to pledge free disk space to the Autonomy’s Network, a secure, decentralized, and scalable blockchain protocol.

By pledging space via the Auto Peer app, users earn Auto Coin, Autonomys' native token. Unlike traditional currencies, Auto Coin operates entirely virtually using secure, distributed blockchain technolog.

However, the demand for and cost of blockspace can lead to varying demand of Auto Coin, causing fluctuations in its value.

Stablecoins, in turn, preserve a constant value over time by linking their worth to stable assets. Enter Auto Cash, Autonomys’ stablecoin. The stability of Auto Cash depends on a dynamic supply of storage in the network.

How does that work?

To maintain Auto Cash's stable value, the protocol adds (mints) more Auto Cash to circulation when its value increases (always capped by the total amount of storage shared with the network by all users) or removes(burns) some when it decreases.

Through this burn-and-mint model, Auto Cash maintains its value. Holders of Auto Coin can then convert to Auto Cash to purchase other currencies like USD EUR, or YEN. Unlike the volatile Worldcoin, Auto Cash offers a stable, affordable digital payment solution for everyday use.
