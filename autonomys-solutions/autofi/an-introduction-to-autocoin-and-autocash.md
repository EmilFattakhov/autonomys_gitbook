# An Introduction to Auto Coin and Auto Cash

Our belief holds that AI can lead to increased decentralization and autonomy, given the right framework for success. The emphasis on autonomy includes both humans and AI as independent entities that, when collaborating, can achieve more than the sum of the parts through collective autonomy.

To join this new world, anyone with a consumer-level computer can download the Auto Peer app to pledge free disk space to the Autonomys Network, a secure, decentralized, and scalable blockchain protocol. By pledging space via the Auto Peer app, users earn Auto Coin, Autonomys' native token. Unlike traditional currencies, Auto Coin operates entirely virtually using secure, distributed blockchain technolog. However, the demand for and cost of blockspace can lead to varying demand for Auto Coin, causing fluctuations in its value.

**Introducing Auto Cash**\
\
**Auto Cash is a stablecoin of the Autonomys Network.** Stablecoins preserve a constant value over time by linking their worth to stable assets (USD, EUR, etc).&#x20;

Auto Cash maintains its stability through a unique algorithm that ties its supply to the total storage capacity pledged by farmers to the Autonomys network. By staking their storage space, farmers not only contribute to the security and scalability of the network but also play a crucial role in regulating the supply of Auto Cash. As more storage is added to the network, the supply of Auto Cash can grow, allowing for increased liquidity and adoption. Conversely, if storage is reduced, the supply of Auto Cash is adjusted accordingly, ensuring that the stablecoin remains fully collateralized and maintains its peg to the underlying currency.

This innovative approach creates a symbiotic relationship between farmers and the AutoFi ecosystem. Farmers are incentivized to provide storage through staking rewards in the form of Auto Coin (ATC), the native token of the Autonomys network. These rewards not only compensate farmers for their vital role in securing the network but also allow them to participate in the growth and governance of the AutoFi ecosystem.
