# An Introduction to Auto Coin

Our belief holds that AI can lead to increased decentralization and autonomy, given the right framework for success. The emphasis on autonomy includes both humans and AI as independent entities that, when collaborating, can achieve more than the sum of the parts through collective autonomy.

To join this new world, anyone with a consumer-level computer can download the Auto Peer app to pledge free disk space to the Autonomys Network, a secure, decentralized, and scalable blockchain protocol. By pledging space via the Auto Peer app, users earn Auto Coin, Autonomys' native token. Unlike traditional currencies, Auto Coin operates entirely virtually using secure, distributed blockchain technology.
