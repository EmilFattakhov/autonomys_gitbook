# Auto Bridge and Auto Swap

**AutoBridge** is a protocol that enables asset movement across different blockchain platforms.

**Auto Bridge** leverages LayerZero technology to provide robust cross-chain compatibility, facilitating the movement of assets like XDM from the consensus chain to EVM-based chains such as Ethereum. LayerZero serves as a pivotal component in this setup, enabling seamless and efficient asset transfers across different blockchain platforms.

Moreover, the Autonomys ecosystem enhanced by not only bridging assets but also supporting unified liquidity pools. This feature allows assets to be moved and utilized across various networks more fluidly, improving liquidity and accessibility without the segmented pools that typically limit traditional bridging solutions.&#x20;

In essence, **Auto Bridge** stands out by offering a simplified yet powerful framework for cross-chain operations, reducing complexity and costs associated with traditional blockchain bridges, and enhancing the overall scalability and functionality of the Autonomys network.
