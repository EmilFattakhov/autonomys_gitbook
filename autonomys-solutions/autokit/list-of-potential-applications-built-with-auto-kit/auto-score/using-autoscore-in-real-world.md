# Using Auto Score in the Real World

## **Letâ€™s have a look at the real-world example usefulness of Auto Score**

Alice, an avid online shopper, relies heavily on product reviews to make informed purchasing decisions. Lately, she's grown disillusioned as she suspects many reviews are generated by AI rather than genuine human experiences. After all, the products Alice buys are meant for humans, not AI, so their reviews can't genuinely gauge the user experience. Unable to trust the authenticity of online reviews, Alice shifts her shopping habits to in-store purchases for better quality assessment. This trend caught on among other online shoppers, leading to a realization that AI-generated reviews compromise product trustworthiness. In response, online shopping platforms begin integrating proof-of-personhood services to ensure human reviewers only. Only the reviews written by entities with a high Auto Score are published on the online shopping platforms. With this change, Alice eagerly returns to the convenience and delight of online shopping, knowing that authenticity is restored.
