# Welcome to Autonomys Academy

Hello! Thanks for taking the time to check our learning resource out. Within these pages, you will find all the information you need to understand what Autonomys is all about and the products we are building on the Autonomys Network.

Please note that this site is still a work in progress. Some products are still having their finer points specified and this MVP of the education plan may not flow quite as nicely as we'd like it to just yet. With that in mind, please do send us feedback about anything you find that is materially wrong or any gaps in the learning journey we ask you to take here. You will find a form at the bottom of the navigation bar.

**To Staff**: Maybe you are working on one of the products we discuss and have updated or corrected information you could pass us?

**To Ambassadors**: Maybe there are concepts that we have not explained? Maybe the explanation is hard to find or not detailed enough?

Your feedback is super important to our process of refinement and iteration to ensure that we reach our goal of the academy being able to convert complete newbies into Autonomys experts.

Taking the embedded assessment before and after learning would be greatly appreciated as a way for us to measure what is working and what is not. No need to overthink the answers - if they are not available off the top of your head before or after, that is the most valuable guidance we could ask for. Thanks!
