# Welcome to The Autonomys Academy

Hello! Thanks for taking the time to check our learning resource out. Within these pages you will find all the information you need to understand what Autonomys is all about and the products we are building on the Autonomys Network.

Please note that this site is still a work in progress. Some products are still having their finer points specified and this MVP of the education plan may not flow quite as nicely as we'd like it to just yet. With that in mind, please do make a note of anything you find that is materially wrong or any gaps in the learning journey we ask you to take. Your feedback is super important to our process of refinement and iteration to ensure that we reach our goal of the academy being able to convert complete newbies into Autonomys experts.
