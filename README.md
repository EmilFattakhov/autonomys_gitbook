# Welcome to Autonomys Academy

Hello! Thanks for taking the time to check our learning resource out. Within these pages, you will find all the information you need to understand what Autonomys is all about and the products we are building on the Autonomys Network.

At a quick glance, Autonomys is a project at the forefront of this paradigmatic shift as the only radical autonomy network at the intersection of web3 x AI (AI3.0). We are building the Autonomys deAI infrastructure stack which will provide everyone with the freedom to control their digital lives and enable them to help shape the future of H+AI collaboration.
