# What are the views for the future (WorldCoin, FetchAI TO EXPAND)

Various perspectives exist regarding the future of artificial intelligence (AI).

Worldcoin introduces a scenario where AI, controlled by a select few companies, dominates 90% of global GDP due to its integration into all aspects of life and replacement of human jobs. According to Worldcoin, this will render human roles obsolete. Their proposed solution involves taxing these dominant companies to redistribute wealth, allowing people to pursue their interests freely. Worldcoin's strategy employs blockchain for centralized distribution of wealth through Universal Basic Income (UBI) and the establishment of a global identity standard, World ID, reinforcing existing power structures rather than dismantling them.

Alternatively, discussions around a dystopian AI era dominate, picturing a world run by AI with minimal human relevance. This vision aligns with the fears of many in the safety research community, suggesting a future where AI overshadows human concerns.

However, these scenarios represent extreme and unfavourable outcomes. Efforts aim to merge the significance of both humans and AI, ensuring cooperation, infrastructure, and a thoughtful approach to a future where both entities enhance each other's capabilities. The goal involves envisioning a world where AI fosters greater decentralization, autonomy, and self-sufficiency.

Inspired by the concept that technological advancements could reduce the cost of virtually everything to near zero, the vision includes a future where robots, possibly rented through Universal Basic Income, perform all tasks. An even more empowering possibility suggests individuals owning the robots and AI themselves.

Our belief holds that AI can lead to increased decentralization and autonomy, given the right framework for success. The emphasis on autonomy includes both humans and AI as independent entities that, when collaborating, can achieve collective autonomy. The objective revolves around crafting a future that supports the coexistence and mutual empowerment of humans and AI.
