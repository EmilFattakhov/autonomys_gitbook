# Sealing the Digital Trust Gap (action needed)

The upcoming 2024 election cycle will be the first time in U.S. history where AI generated content will be used in political ads by campaigns and parties.

In a world lacking a method for distinguishing between human beings, organizations and AI systems, AI agents and AI providers find no obstructions to spread misinformation and influence elections unscathed.

With no clear mechanism to disclose the provenance of AI-generated content in political ads, generated content manipulates and deceives people on a large scale, with devastating consequences for national security and election security.



Auto ID offers a comprehensive framework for proving the provenance of AI-generated content, detecting malicious AI activity, and verifying human identity online, enhancing transparency, security, and trust in digital spaces.

🤖 Auto ID for Transparency: Auto ID enables creators like Alice to prove their content is AI-generated through a verifiable process, ensuring transparency and honesty in online publications.

🔍 Semantic Hashing for Consistency: Utilizes Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) techniques for generating semantic hashes of content, allowing for verification of original and edited content by comparing their semantic hashes.

🌐 Platform Verification: Platforms can verify the provenance of content through Auto ID and semantic hashes, rendering seals (e.g., a green smiling robot icon) to indicate verified AI-generated content.

🚫 Automated Detection of Malicious AI Content: Auto ID helps detect AI-generated malicious content by using semantic hashes and joint Auto IDs for each AI model, allowing platforms to flag and potentially take action against disinformation.

👤 Human Verification Online: Auto ID assists in proving human identity on online platforms, reducing the need for captchas and simplifying sign-up processes by linking verified accounts and employing proof-of-personhood systems.

🛡️ Combatting Fake Accounts: The framework significantly increases the difficulty and cost of creating fake accounts by requiring a reasonable human score, verified through multiple well-known providers.

📈 Enhancing Online Trust and Security: Through transparency in AI-generated content, easy human verification, and stricter measures against fake accounts, Auto ID aims to improve trust and security across online platforms.
