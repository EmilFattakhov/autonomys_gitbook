# Potential Applications

Below is an overview of several potential applications that could be built either off-chain with Auto Kit or deployed on-chain as smart control rollups.

**Autonomys Identity (Auto ID)**

1. **Auto Score** is a probability rating that indicates the likelihood that entity with an Auto ID is either a natural or artificial entity. It is based on composing verifiable claims such as the possession of existing online identities or a certificate issued by an AI service provider.
2. [**LetsID.ai**](http://letsid.ai) is a free off-chain service provided by Autonomys Labs, that allows anyone to easily create and manage an Auto ID by connecting an existing OIDC compatible account that has a verified identity, without having to manage a blockchain wallet or purchase Auto Coin.
3. **Auto Verify** is a framework for demonstrating and detecting the provenance of AI generated content based on semantic hashing and digital signatures. It allows AI service providers to easily document and track content produced by their models, while also allowing any online platform to easily authenticate the authenticity of content published by their users.
4. **Auto Auth** is an Open ID Connect (OIDC) compatible login and authentication system that allows users to login to existing websites and apps with their Auto ID. It may also be implemented as an Auth0 integration to allow Auto Auto to be the default signup flow.
5. **Agent ID** is a framework for AI developers and service providers that allows for the identification, authentication, and authorization of autonomous AI agents acting on behalf of human users in a secure and trustworthy manner.
6. **Auto PKI** is a framework for deploying unique instances of the Auto ID registry for application or industry specific use cases, such a or consortium based identity systems.

**Autonomous Finance (AutoFi)**

1. **Auto Pay** is simple payment integration that allows merchants to receive Auto Cash as a form of payment for online goods and services, turning Auto Cash into an online debit card.
2. **Auto Save** is an automated staking protocol that allows holders of Auto Coin and Auto Cash to re-stake earnings, turning every auto account into an interest bearing savings account.
3. **Auto Loan** is an automated, collateralized lending and borrowing protocol that allows users to lend Auto Coin and Auto Cash while earning interest.
4. **Auto Swap** is an automated Decentralized Exchange (DEX) for converting tokens between Auto Coin and all Auto Cash fiat pairs, allowing users to easily move money globally.
5. **Auto Bridge** is a cross-chain bridging protocol that allows users to transport assets between blockchain networks, providing liquidity other DeFi ecosystems.
6. **Auto Rails** is framework for deploying unique instances of a cryptocurrency under a seperate rollup such as a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or CeFi stablecoin.

**Autonomous Collective (AutoCo)**

1. **Nomic DAO** is the native governance protocol of the Autonomys network, with voting rights based on possession of the Nomic governance token.
2. **Auto DAO** is a framework for deploying unique instances of an Auto Collective for application specific or private use-cases that employ AI facilitated governance.
3. **Global DAO** is an open network of Auto DAOs that supports humaic consensus and Open Collective Intelligence (OCI) at global scale, providing a decentralized, bottom-up alternative to centralized, monolithic AGI and ASI.
